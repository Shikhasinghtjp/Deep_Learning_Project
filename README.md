*COMPANY*: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

*NAME*: SHIKHA SINGH JAYANTI PRASAD THAKUR

*INTERN ID*: CT04DN874

*DOMAIN*: DATA SCIENCE

*DURATION*: 4 weeks

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTOSH![image]



A compact Python implementation for exploring deep learning concepts. The script (`Deep_Learning.py`) demonstrates creating, training, and evaluating a neural network on a dataset‚Äîideal for learning or quick experimentation.

## üß† Features

- Defines a configurable neural network architecture
- Loads a standard dataset (e.g., MNIST/CIFAR)
- Trains the model with validation
- Outputs performance metrics (accuracy, loss curves)
