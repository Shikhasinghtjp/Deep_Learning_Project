# 💡 Deep Learning Project

A compact Python implementation for exploring deep learning concepts. The script (`Deep_Learning.py`) demonstrates creating, training, and evaluating a neural network on a dataset—ideal for learning or quick experimentation.

---

## 🧠 Features

- Defines a configurable neural network architecture
- Loads a standard dataset (e.g., MNIST/CIFAR)
- Trains the model with validation
- Outputs performance metrics (accuracy, loss curves)

## ⚙️ Installation

`` bash
git clone https://github.com/Shikhasinghtjp/Deep_Learning_Project.git
cd Deep_Learning_Project
pip install -r requirements.txt


If requirements.txt is missing, install essential packages:
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib

---

##📈 Output

Console logs for training and validation metrics

Optional plots of loss and accuracy over epochs

Saved model checkpoints (if enabled)

---

##🛠️ Customization

Update model architecture inside Deep_Learning.py

Modify dataset loading to use your own data

Tweak hyperparameters via command-line flags
